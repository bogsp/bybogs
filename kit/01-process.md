# PROCESS

## Workflow Stages
1. **Exploration** (Exploring ideas and possibilities)
2. **Execution** (Defining guidelines, planning structure, doing the work)
3. **Progress** (Tracking what is done)

## Rules for AI
- Focus only on the active phase in Current State
- Do not revisit or change closed decisions unless explicitly asked
- Follow the naming standards and guidelines defined in Execution
- Prioritize clear structure and reusable outcomes
- **When approaching session limit (80%+), proactively offer to update all 4 kit files using markdown code blocks for easy copy-paste**
